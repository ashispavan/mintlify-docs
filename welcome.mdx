 ## Why I'm Building an AI Engineering Blog

AI is moving ridiculously fast ‚Äî like, blink-and-you-miss-it fast. There‚Äôs always some new tool, a shiny API, or a groundbreaking paper that drops out of nowhere. For someone like me, who comes from a web development background, jumping into AI feels a bit like getting dropped into a sci-fi movie‚Ä¶ without the script.

That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to spin up [ai.ashis.dev](https://ai.ashis.dev) ‚Äî a place to document everything I‚Äôm learning as I fumble, explore, and occasionally figure stuff out in the world of AI.

## Documenting My Learning Journey

This isn't a domain I originally come from. I live in the world of web apps, JavaScript frameworks, weird CSS bugs, and responsive UIs. So when I started exploring things like tokenization, self-supervision, and vector embeddings, I realized I needed a better way to **compartmentalize** what I was learning.

Blogging in a linear, narrative format is great ‚Äî and I‚Äôll continue doing that on [ashis.dev](https://ashis.dev/blog)‚Äî but AI demands more structure. Hence, this documentation site.

## A Digital Garden for My AI Mind

Think of this site as my **AI garden** ‚Äî not a finished product, but a growing collection of notes, guides, snippets, and experiments.

Here's what you'll find (or eventually find) here:

- AI engineering basics (tokens, RAG, parameters, etc.)
- Experiments with tools like Cursor, V0.dev, and Windurf
- Rules of thumb and mental models for using AI tools effectively
- Technical paper breakdowns (like ‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù)
- Prompt engineering tips and real-world use cases
- Project notes and build logs as I try to make sense of all this

## For Me, But Also for You

Selfishly, this blog is for me ‚Äî to organize what I‚Äôm learning and revisit it later. But I‚Äôm also writing it in public because someone else out there is probably on a similar journey, trying to figure out how this LLM-shaped puzzle fits together.

If that‚Äôs you, I hope you find something useful here. Or at the very least, a nudge to start your own learning blog.

## And Honestly‚Ä¶ Just for Fun

I like writing. I like maintaining things. I like building weird corners of the internet for no reason other than **because I can**. This blog scratches that itch.

So welcome to my AI notes, my docs-in-progress, and my slightly chaotic but hopeful attempt to make sense of one of the most exciting fields in tech.

Let‚Äôs see where this goes üöÄ
